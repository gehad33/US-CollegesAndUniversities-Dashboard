# US Colleges and Universities

## Project Description and Usage 
This is a customized dashboard to show the colleges and universities' data in the US,
I used in the dashboard; arcgis api for javascript and Cedar library which uses amCharts library as its charting engine, esri/arcgis-rest-feature-layer and esri/arcgis-rest-request to query feature data

the dashboard clusters the data and shows popups for its data, also have 4 charts:
    - Number of students per city
    - Number of schools per state 
    - Number of students per state 
    - Number of schools per city
and these charts are interactive with the map so the charts display the data of the current map extent

and there are some other features such as a drop down list at the top right to zoom per the desired city, and in the bottom middle you can zoom by the university name,

also there are two hard facts gathered from this feature layer api about the number of students enrolled in the US and the total number of colleges and universites in the US.
